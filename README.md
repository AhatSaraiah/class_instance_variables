##Class variables VS  Instance variables 
In object-oriented programming, variables at the class level are referred to as class variables, whereas variables at the object level are called instance variables.

This differentiation allows us to use class variables to initialize objects with a specific value assigned to variables and use different variables for each object with instance variables.

Making use of class- and instance-specific variables can ensure that our code adheres to the DRY principle to reduce repetition within code.
